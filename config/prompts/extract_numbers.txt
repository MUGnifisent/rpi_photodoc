- Dates and times (years, months, days, hours, deadlines)
- Quantities and measurements (units, volumes, weights, distances)
- Percentages and ratios
- Reference numbers (IDs, codes, phone numbers, addresses)
- Statistics and metrics (scores, ratings, performance indicators)
- Technical specifications (dimensions, capacities, limits)

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
- Page numbers, line numbers, or formatting artifacts
- Extremely common numbers (like "1st", "2nd" in ordinal context)
- Numbers that are part of obvious OCR errors

TABLE FORMAT:
Create a markdown table with columns: "Category | Description | Value | Unit/Context"

CATEGORIES TO USE:
- Financial, Date/Time, Quantity, Percentage, Reference, Technical, Other
